**TourDeForce** is a portfolio to-do list app.
It uses [Gamification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification) through awards, to make completion of projects and their items more compelling.

## Authors and acknowledgment
The app is based on the **Ultimate Portfolio App** course from [Paul Hudson (@twostraws)](https://twitter.com/twostraws) at [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/).  
I would like to thank Paul for not only guiding us through his part of the code, but also for the amazing contributions (in both scope an clarity) that he has made to the Swift community.

All other code is written by the maintainer of this repository, [Tor Rafsol LÃ¸seth (@loseth)](https://twitter.com/loseth).

## Project status
Not ready for deployment. More to do:

- Documentation and testing
- Localization (English and Hungarian done, add French, German and Norwegian + ?)
- Multiplatform (iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS)
- New visual design, including awards symbols
	- Make awards more valuable
- Settle on business model, if any
